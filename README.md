# Turtle-Checkers
[ Python 3 Turtle Library ] Pilot-Test: Checkers

[ INTRODUCTION ]
Even thought the original purpose of this project is about "Minimax With Alpha-Beta Pruning Agent",
the performance test of Python Turtle is still meaningful to demonstrate,
such that the project is shared throughout this GitHub page.

Turtle can help in drawing objects on its virtual canvas.
Other than utilising Turtle, there can be much more professional approaches
such as composing individual graphic engines by exploiting Vulkan, OpenGL, etc.
Nevertheless, one major advantage of using Turtle is derived from its simplicity.
Turtle has already prepared its own drawing methods,
which can be convenient in terms of educational purposes.

In addition, Turtle is a sort of basic components in Python 3,
so predominantly additional installations like "pip" are not required.

This project demonstates the performance test of Turtle,
playing a simple checkers board game.
